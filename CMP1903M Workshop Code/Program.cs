            //2. For each string:
            //      Count each character in the string
            //      The maximum is the character
            //3. Output the unencrypted message.

            //Week 3
            //Task 1: create Message object, call the readTextFromInput() method
            //Task 2: create Atbash object Step 1: pass message to encode() method Step 2: put in the encode logic
            //Task 3: put in the decode logic to the decode() method, check if it works
            //Task 4: read text to encode from a file
